Mon: This is the first time I have used Rust in two months, and while rereading old programs, I noticed I have never done any files reading or writing, which is a rather fundamental thing in any language. Pokemon showdown usage files was the first thing that came to my mind (I'm trying to get good at vgc but this hasn't gone very well), but I only notice how awkwardly the file is structured and that parsing wouldn't do it any good. I thought it would be interesting to write a Regex for it anyways so now I end up with a not very good program that pastes the name of the pokemons in a format that is actually harder to read than the original file? It is interesting as a proof of concept anyhow and I can always improve it later
Pokemon showdown actually is open source and has an API, so writing an extension of it might interest me in the future.
